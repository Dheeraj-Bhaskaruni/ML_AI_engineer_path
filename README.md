      - Scaler => mean = 0 and std = 1
      - Min-Max => min = 0, max =1
      - Binning data =>is the process of taking numerical or categorical data and breaking it up into groups.
      - Natural Log Transformation => Operable Right skewed data
    - Encoding Categorical Variables
    - Project : Transforming Data into features
  - Supervised Learning I: Regressors, Classifiers and Trees
    - Regression vs Classification
      - Regression: Regression is used to predict outputs that are continuous. The outputs are quantities that can be flexibly determined based on the inputs of the model rather than being confined to a set of possible labels.
      - Classification : Classification is used to predict a discrete label. The outputs fall under a finite set of possible outcomes.\
        - Classification types : Binary Classification, Multi-class classification
