While working on a file, you find a small bug in a separate file from a previous commit that needs to be fixed before you continue.

$ git stash

Running the command above will store your work temporarily for later use in a hidden directory.

At this point, you can switch branches and do work elsewhere.

Once the bug is fixed, you want to retrieve the code you were working on previously, you can “pop” the work that was stored when you used git stash.

$ git stash pop

From here, you can continue your work and commit it when ready.

Coming up we have a short video demo’ing this in action.
