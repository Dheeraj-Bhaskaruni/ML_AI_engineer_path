Git alias commands
When grouping commands together, you can end up writing very long lines of Git commands in the terminal such as:

$ git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph

Fortunately, Git offers a helpful feature that can make your Git experience simpler, easier, and more familiar: aliases.

If you have a set of commands that you use regularly and want to save some time from typing them, you can easily set up an alias for each command using Git config.

Below are a couple of examples:

$ git config --global alias.co "checkout"
$ git config --global alias.br "branch"
$ git config --global alias.glop "log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph"

Once the aliases are configured, next time you want to check out to another branch you could type the command:

$ git co example_branch

Instead of:

$ git checkout example_branch

Using Git aliases can create a much more fluid and efficient workflow experience when using Git. By getting creative with your aliases, you’re able to wrap a sequence of Git commands into one in order to save time and effort.
